# Introduction

This article introduces convolutional networks and shows how to implement one from scratch in Python.
Here are the topics we'll cover:

- Definition of cross-correlation.
- Typical convolutional layers.
- Pooling.
- Derivation of the differential of convolutional layers for gradient descent.
- AlexNet.
